**Plate:** AOP layout (numpad + arrow keys).

**Layout:** ISO

## Known bugs

* `X` and `W` are mapped on the same keycode (soldering?)
* `C` is mapped on `X`
* `<>` is not detected
* `*` is not detected


## How to flash

The HB85 uses the ATMEGA32A. It is not natively detected by VIA. Make sure you have the [QMK Docker Container](qmk_docker) ready.

1. If needed, create a new version of the `hb85_*.json` file (use [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/))
2. Enable bootloader mode by by holding `F3` while plugging the kb. The leds will blink while the bootloader mode is on.
3. Launch the docker container `docker start -i qmk`. It should have `bootloadhid` & co installed.
4. Flash the keyboard with `qmk flash /tmp/<hb85_config>.json --bootloader bootloadhid`
